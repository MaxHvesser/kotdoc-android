### KotDoc

KotDoc is a small consumer of the [Official Kotlin Language documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html), wrapped in an Android App format. The documentation is fetched from the [Kotlin GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-site/tree/master/pages/docs/reference) and parsed into conventional lists/screens. Content is provided as-is and is not curated by the author of this repository.

This app serves as a mobile friendly way to peruse the Kotlin documentation, considering the offical docs are not provided in a mobile format.
